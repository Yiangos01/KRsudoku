# KRsudoku

### In this project we implement x wing sudoku solving technique in order to 
### compare the Naive and a more advanced approach of solving reasoning

# How to run the solver

### To run this experiment use the command <python sudoku.py <file.csv> <m,p> <x,' '>>
### -file.csv stands for a file with unsolved sudokus
### -m or p stands for the SAT solver that you want to use, p for picoSAT and m for miniSAT
### the difference is on the result data.
### -x or ' ' if you want to apply x wing write x

# Data
### Sudokus are grouped into categories based on its complexity and diffficulty
